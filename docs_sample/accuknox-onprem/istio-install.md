## Istio Installion steps:  

1. Go to the Istio release page to download the installation file for your OS, or download  and extract the latest release automatically (Linux or macOS): 
```sh
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.10.0 TARGET_ARCH=x86_64 sh - 
```
2. Move to the Istio package directory. For example, if the package is istio-1.11.3:      
```sh 
cd istio-1.10.0 
```
3. Create a namespace istio-system for Istio components: 
```sh
kubectl create namespace istio-system 
```
4. Install the Istio base chart which contains cluster-wide resources used by the Istio  control plane: 
```sh
helm install istio-base manifests/charts/base -n istio-system
```
5. Install the Istio discovery chart which deploys the istiod control plane service: 
```sh
helm install istiod manifests/charts/istio-control/istio-discovery -n istio-system  
```
6. Install the Istio ingress gateway chart which contains the ingress gateway components: 
```sh
helm install istio-ingress manifests/charts/gateways/istio-ingress -n istio-system
```  
## Verifying the installation:  
Ensure all Kubernetes pods in istio-system namespace are deployed and have a STATUS of Running:  

```sh
kubectl get pods -n istio-system
```
## Installing Gateway  
Along with creating a service mesh, Istio allows you to manage gateways, which are Envoy  proxies running at the edge of the mesh, providing fine-grained control over traffic entering and  leaving the mesh. 
## Add accuknox repositories to install istio helm package:
```sh
helm repo add accuknox-onprem-prerequisites https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@agents.accuknox.com/repository/accuknox-onprem-prerequisites
helm repo update
helm search repo accuknox-onprem-prerequisites
helm pull accuknox-onprem-prerequisites/istio-gateway-charts --untar
```
Move to directory  
```sh 
cd  istio-gateway-charts
```
## Cert Manager 
Install cert-manager. Cert-manager will manage the certificates of gateway domains.  
## Setup permissions  
When running on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), you might encounter a ‘permission denied’  error when creating some of the required resources. 

```sh
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud config get-value core/account)  
```
## Install Cert-manager  

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.3.1/cert-manager.yaml
```
## Platform-istio-gateway
Istio Gateway configurations for DNS  
This gateway config file defines the base API endpoints of the micro services under DNS  
This repository also contains necessary files to setup SSL for DNS (Refer issuer.yaml and cert.yaml) using  cert-manager  
## Create Gateway  
Find the Gateway IP
  
```sh
INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o  jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')  
This will give you a LoadBalancer IP  
echo ${INGRESS_HOST} 
```
## Create DNS 
Create A record for example (sample.example.com and keycloak.example.com) using LoadBalancer IP  # Create a certificate  
Issuers, and ClusterIssuers, are Kubernetes resources that represent certificate authorities (CAs)  that are able to generate signed certificates by honoring certificate signing requests. 

```sh
kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml 
kubectl get ClusterIssuer -n cert-manager # Should have Status as Ready 
```
A Certificate is a namespaced resource that references an Issuer or ClusterIssuer that  determine what will be honoring the certificate request. 

```sh
kubectl apply -f cert.yaml 
kubectl get Certificate -n istio-system # Should have Status as Ready # Create gateway with SSL  
kubectl apply -f gateway-with-ssl.yaml` [No need to specify namespace] # Apply Virtual Service  
```
A VirtualService defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a host is addressed. Each  routing rule defines matching criteria for traffic of a specific protocol. If the traffic is matched,  then it is sent to a named destination service (or subset/version of it) defined in the registry.  

```sh
kubectl apply -f backend-api/virtual-service.yaml
``` 
[No need to specify namespace] kubectl apply -f keycloak/virtual-service.yaml # [No need to specify namespace]
