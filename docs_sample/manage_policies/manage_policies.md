-   Policy Name
    
    -   Name of the Policy
        
-   Description
    
    -   Description for the Policy
        
-   Policy Type
    
    -   Policy Type can be Network-Ingress, Network-Egress and System. Ingress-Policy will apply to all network packets which are entering the endpoint. Egress-Policy will apply to all network packets which are leaving the endpoint. System Policy will restrict behavior at system level.
        
    -   To set up the network security select policy type to be Network-ingress or Network-egress.
        
-   Namespace
    
    -   Namespace will tell in which namespace that policy is going to apply.
        
-   Default/Node
    
    -   This is used to differentiate between Endpoint Selector(default) and Node Selector(Node). It is called Endpoint Selector because it only applies to labels associated with an Endpoint. Node Selector applies to labels associated with a node in the cluster.
        
-   Labels
    
    -   Labels are used to select specified endpoints (in most cases it will be pods) and nodes.
        

### **Add Rules**

Once the Policy has been created, You will be directed to the Add rules screen.

Another way is to select Policy Manager → All Policies. Selecting a policy from All Policies list page will expand the policy details and access `+` icon to add rules.

The Add rule interface provides an easy way to add rules to or remove rules from a Policy; Rules will differ based on your policy type you chose.
